FactoryTalk View Studio is a HMI design environment by Rockwell Automation. FactoryTalk depends on a variety of separate programs and services to operate properly. Numerous thing may cause these services to stop interacting as designed.

This tool is a Windows Powershell script designed to correct some common issues without requiring the user to restart the software or reboot the computer.

## Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

The first time this script is executed, the user may encounter the following prompt:

```
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
```
The user is responsible for understanding the security implications of this action and should not use this script

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    TSwearingen@alassystems.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!

## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
